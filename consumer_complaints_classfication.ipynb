On XX/XX/2019, I attempted to deposit a check into my account and I received a message stating that I was over my monthly mobile deposit limit. I was confused because it was the first of the month and I had not deposited any checks since the previous month. I called BB & T and they said that I couldnt deposit checks into business accounts via the mobile app even though I had done that before. \\n\\nI was instructed to open a personal account, into which I could deposit checks via the mobile app. I was told that if I opened the account online I would have immediate access, that I could link my personal and business accounts, and immediately be able to transfer money between them. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened my personal account online. Though I successfully opened online, I did not have online access as I had been promised. Because I was traveling in an area where there were no BB & T branches, I could not go into a branch until XX/XX/2019. In the intervening time, my business account became overdrawn. I had the money in my personal account to bring it back into the black, but BB & T could not make the transfer until I went into a branch. During this time, I incurred an astonishing {$320.00} in overdraft fees in my business account because I had no way of transferring money between the two accounts. \\n\\nWhen I went into the branch, I met with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX County, Florida. She investigated the accounts and told me she would link them and that I would have online access in XXXX hours. The online access still never material, I was not able to transfer money and I received an additional {$36.00} overdraft fee. This brought the total to {$360.00} in overdraft fees. \\n\\nI had only opened the second account on BB & Ts advice ; I could have had my customer send a bank wire directly into business account in the first week of XXXX to keep the account positive. My TOTAL deposits between the two accounts was always positive. \\n\\nI requested a refund and was told they would not refund any of the fees.'\n",

We then started to negotiate the return of our leased vehicle and asked the team there to please help us getting an interesting deal on another vehicle and explaining our difficult credit situation of my wife and myself. \\nThe leased car we were returning had a that time about {$2800.00} dollar amount of excess millage on the lease terms, and we were assured by the sales manager that by purchasing a new XXXX that day at the dealership that we will be able to negotiate that bill with the financial department of the company later on. Also, when you return a lease, you must pay a excess wear and use of the car but can be waived that fee again by purchasing a new vehicle. \\nAfter a couple of hours of negotiation and a lot of persuasion from the sales team who promised us a lot of benefits, we ended up returning the lease and purchasing a brand new XXXX vehicle. \\nDue to our bad credit history, we got a the new car financed with an APR of 8.39 %. \\n\\nA couple days following our purchase, me and my wife got very surprised about 2 things. \\n\\nFirst of all, as we both checked our credit on XXXX XXXX, we realized that the dealership submitted a lot of credit check to our accounts, not even telling us that will happen. This really affected both our credit history and score. Knowing our credit situation at the dealership, i really do believe that we got kind of scammed that time. \\n\\nSecond, after receiving the end of lease bill by mail, i have contacted the financial department like i was instructed by the sales manager at the dealership in order to discuss it, knowing that he promised me since i have bought a new XXXX vehicle. \\nover the phone with the financial consultant, i was very surprised to hear that nothing was possible, no negotiation on the total amount and no waiver for the excess wear as well, since that apparently we did not get the new car financed with the in-house XXXX financing agency. thing that nor the salesman, or the sales manager told us upon signing the new car purchasing contract. \\n\\ni really need your help in that matter, i really believe we got scammed by the XXXX team, pursuing us to buy a brand new XXXX vehicle in order to get all the benefits that we will never get at the end.'\n",

We have no family, friends, nor business connections in the country - we were simply there to visit a new place and experience a new culture. Except for one elegant XXXX XXXX XXXX   dinner ( {$200.00} USD ) and a cash advance to take out Euros ( {$250.00} USD ), all of our purchases were below {$70.00} USD. \\n\\nOn our final day in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, we were eating lunch at a restaurant and I planned to pay with my Chase Sapphire card. The waiter said there was a problem with the wireless internet and took my Chase Sapphire card inside the restaurant ( we were seated outside on the patio ). He was in possession of my Chase Sapphire care for approximately 10 minutes outside of my supervision. He returned and claimed the internet was down and said we could pay in USD or go get Euros from a specific ATM that he directed us to in the back of a neighboring store. I opted to go to the ATM and get Euros in order to pay for our lunch because we were worried we would get scammed on the exchange rate he would try and offer us if we paid in USD. \\n\\nAfter resolving the issue at the restaurant and returning home within the next couple of days, I noticed a fraudulent charge for {$5500.00} on my Chase Sapphire card and another attempted charge for about the same amount that was declined by Chase. The statement showed that the fraudulent charge was made at XXXX XXXX, and after some research online I found this to be a marble gravestone/tomb manufacturing business. The charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX, it posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, and I noticed the charge on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately called Chase to dispute the charge. My mind immediately jumped to the situation with the restaurant ( see above ) when the card was out of my possession for about 10 minutes and I was directed to use a specific ATM. I relayed these same facts during my dispute claim and answered all questions and provided all details they asked for, and then I waited to hear back from Chase with a resolution. In addition to disputing the fraudulent charge with Chase, I also tracked down an email for the vendor where the fraudulent charge was made, XXXX XXXX, and emailed them on multiple occasions ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) to explain the situation and request a refund for the fraudulent charge. I also submitted the same inquiry and request on the \" messages \\'\\' portion of their website on XX/XX/XXXX. I haven\\'t heard any response from the business as of XX/XX/XXXX. Due to their lack of response, I also left a negative, public review of the business on XXXX explaining their lack of response to my inquiries about the fraudulent charge in hopes of deterring any potential REAL customers of using their services in the future. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received a letter from Chase saying that my fraud claim had been denied because they deemed that I had received a benefit from the fraudulent charge. I immediately started the appeal process by calling Chase. After waiting on hold for 3 hours, I was told to send an email with my credit card number and full name to XXXX in order to file an appeal. Despite my security concerns of sending my credit card number via email, I felt I had no other options and on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX with my name and credit card number and requested to start the appeal process. I also requested the following information : a copy of the receipt of this fraudulent charge ( {$5500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) and/or all relevant information ( time, date, address, swipe/chip/punch in numbers, etc. ), a copy of the receipts of all other charges made on XX/XX/XXXX on this account and/or all relevant information ( time, date, address, swipe/chip/punch in numbers, etc. ), and a copy of the report that includes a. ) all information that I provided to Chase about this fraudulent charge and b. ) an explanation of exactly why it was denied and deemed that I received a benefit. \\n\\nAfter not hearing back from Chase, I sent another email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that my appeal request had been received and to request a phone call or email to confirm that it had been received and let me know that the appeal was in process. \\n\\nI received a phone call from Chase \\'s fraud dispute review department on XX/XX/XXXX confirming that my appeal request had been received. The representative who I talked with told me that he believed my claim was indeed fraudulent and relayed that he didn\\'t believe the fraud department looked at the claim closely enough. He said that they never requested a receipt from the vendor ( XXXX XXXX ) to compare the signature with other receipts on file and he also shared that there were two successive charges in two  different counties in XXXX that they didn\\'t take into account when reviewing it because I couldn\\'t possibly be in two places at once. I also continued to request to see the receipt for the fraudulent charge, receipts for all other charges on XX/XX/XXXX, and the report that detailed the denial of the fraudulent claim. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Chase refuses to send me this information about my fraudulent charge claim, and I believe I have a right to see this as a Chase customer. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that my appeal of my fraudulent charge dispute had been denied, meaning that Chase is holding me responsible to pay the {$5500.00} fraudulent charge.
